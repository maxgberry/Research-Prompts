Today, I created a new language called **Guenael Symbolic Code** to map systems.

I realized that working within natural language had its limits and semantic boundaries, especially when dealing with complex systems.

So, I developed **Guenael**—a symbolic language that allows me to step outside those boundaries and do things differently.

### What Is A System?

> A group of interconnected elements that work together for a specific purpose.

from _Donella Meadows._

To make this work, I also had to create three AI prompts that help me translate the **Guenael** system.

These prompts allow me to visualize how different parts of a system connect and interact, which has been extremely helpful in understanding and improving systems.

### What Is Guenael?

The goal of **Guenael** is to make complex systems easier to understand and work with. It packs a lot of information into a simple, systematic format. This language allows you to break down complicated systems into manageable pieces without losing the bigger picture.

It’s useful for anyone who needs to understand how systems work, whether you’re doing academic research or trying to solve real-world problems.

If you’re interested in exploring how this works, you can **try it now** using ChatGPT for free.
