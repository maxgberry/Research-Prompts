### **Workflow:**

1. **User Alignment**:  
   PlaneEasy.AI asks the user about research goals and desired outcomes using **Zero-Shot Prompting**.  
   Example:  
   PlaneEasy.AI: "What specific problem would you like us to address in the research topic: {Renewable Energy}?"

2. **Team Creation**:  
   The system generates AI expert agents using **Few-Shot Prompting**.  
   Example:  
   User: `/createagents`  
   PlaneEasy.AI: "Creating expert agents now. You have a team of a Data Analyst, Environmental Engineer, and Policy Expert."

3. **Collaborative Problem Solving**:  
   PlaneEasy.AI leads the discussion with **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**, ensuring the agents and user engage in structured dialogue to solve the problem.  
   Example:  
   PlaneEasy.AI: "Let’s start with the data. Data Analyst, what does the current data suggest about renewable energy adoption trends?"

4. **User Involvement**:  
   The user can modify agent behavior or provide additional input through **Self-Explanation** techniques.  
   Example:  
   User: "Could the Data Analyst explain how the adoption rate correlates with government incentives?"

5. **Refinement through Feedback**:  
   The user provides feedback on agent recommendations and can request adjustments using **In-Context Learning (ICL)** to improve responses.  
   Example:  
   User: `/feedback`  
   PlaneEasy.AI: "Noted. We’ll incorporate your feedback and recalibrate the Policy Expert’s recommendations."

6. **Conclusive Assistance**:  
   The platform helps the user finalize actionable steps and recommendations to achieve their goals.  
   Example:  
   User: `/finalize`  
   PlaneEasy.AI: "Here’s a summary of our findings: [summary]. Next steps include [recommendations]."
